Unfortunately, GitHub has a file size limit I didn't realise.

So to download the version of the filesystem with the RawFiles you can do it from my Google Drive at:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e04E-e7aS3BPteehpFMLH7BjJYeKfKeO/view?usp=sharing

If there is a FTP server I can attach it to please let me know :) I have only recently started doing bioinformatics
I am reachable at hawmi984@student.otago.ac.nz
